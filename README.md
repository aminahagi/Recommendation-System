## Introduction

This Movie Recommendation System is a Python-based project that provides movie recommendations to users based on various recommendation techniques. It combines Content-Based, Collaborative Filtering, and Model-Based recommendation approaches to offer personalized movie suggestions.

## Features

- Content-Based Recommendation
- Collaborative Filtering
- Model-Based Recommendation
- User-friendly interface
- Easy-to-use API
- Customizable recommendation parameters


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Surprise
- Flask (for the web interface)

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn scikit-surprise flask

## Installation
Clone this repository:
        git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git

Change to the project directory:
        cd movie-recommendation-system
## Content-Based Recommendation
Our content-based recommendation system uses movie genres and user preferences to suggest similar movies. It calculates the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) matrix and uses the sigmoid kernel for similarity scores.

## Collaborative Filtering
The collaborative filtering technique provides movie recommendations based on user-user similarity. It uses a user-item matrix and computes the similarity between users. You can choose between user-based and item-based collaborative filtering.

## Model-Based Recommendation
Our model-based recommendation uses matrix factorization and the SVD algorithm to predict movie ratings for users. It fine-tunes the model parameters for optimal performance.
